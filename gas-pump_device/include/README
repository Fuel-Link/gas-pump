This directory is intended for project header files.

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
to be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a
header file in your project source file (C, C++, etc) located in `src` folder
by including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include'.

```src/main.c

#include "header.h"

int main (void)
{
 ...
}
```

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file
into each source file that needs it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With a header file, the related declarations appear
in only one place. If they need to be changed, they can be changed in one
place, and programs that include the header file will automatically use the
new version when next recompiled. The header file eliminates the labor of
finding and changing all the copies as well as the risk that a failure to
find one copy will result in inconsistencies within a program.

In C, the usual convention is to give header files names that end with `.h'.
It is most portable to use only letters, digits, dashes, and underscores in
header file names, and at most one dot.

# Configuring WiFi Credentials

For increased protection, since this projects is supposed to be hosted online, 
wifi credentials for the device should be present in a file named `WiFiCredentials.h`. 
You should create this file in this directory, with the following sintax:

```c++
//! SSID of your internet WiFi
const char WIFI_SSID[] = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID"; // CHANGE IT
//! Password of your internet enabled WiFi network
const char WIFI_PASSWORD[] = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"; // CHANGE IT
//! IP address of the MQTT broker
const char MQTT_SERVER_IP[] = "YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_IP_ADDRESS"; // CHANGE IT
```

# Connecting to Ditto

Before flashing and starting the license plate reader, don't forget to first start 
and run the Ditto successfully, by following guide in the respective directory. Consider the 
**ThingID** obtained uppon creation of the *Thing* object. A **ThingID** is composed of two elements,
the **ThingID** value itself and a **Namespace** where *Things* can belong two, in this 
way making policies and modification simpler. The **ThingID** value is then composed in the format
`Namespace:ThingID`. With this information, head over to the `CommsHandler.h` file and 
paste the information, according to the following example:

```c++
//! URL or Host name of the API service
const char* IN_TOPIC = "plate-reader/org.eclipse.ditto:c5ae6b75-3da1-4cd3-b0c5-ff22fa509233/downlink";
const char* OUT_TOPIC = "plate-reader/org.eclipse.ditto:c5ae6b75-3da1-4cd3-b0c5-ff22fa509233/uplink";
const char* IMAGE_TOPIC = "plate-reader/org.eclipse.ditto:c5ae6b75-3da1-4cd3-b0c5-ff22fa509233/imageCaptured";
const char* THING_ID = "c5ae6b75-3da1-4cd3-b0c5-ff22fa509233";
const char* NAMESPACE = "org.eclipse.ditto";
```

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1884 -t gas-pump/org.eclipse.ditto:gas-pump-uuid/downlink -m "{\"msgType\":1,\"thingId\":\"org.eclipse.ditto:gas-pump-uuid\",\"timestamp\":\"2024-05-13T16:14:18+0100\",\"topic\":\"org.eclipse.ditto/gas-pump-uuid/things/twin/commands/create\",\"path\":\"/features/authorize_supply/properties/\",\"authorization\": \"true\"}"
